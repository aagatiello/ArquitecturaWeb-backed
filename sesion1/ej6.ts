// You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N].
// The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b").
// The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1.
// In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

// It takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted
// and return the number of occurreces
